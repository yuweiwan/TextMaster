Owing to the importance of surface passivation to BSi, major passivation techniques using SiNx, thermal oxide, Al2O3 and a-Si have been critically examined. It is found that atomic layer deposited Al2O3 offers excellent surface conformality and passivation to the silicon surface, especially on p+-emitters. With ALD Al2O3 passivation, a record high 18.7% efficient BSi solar cell has been successfully fabricated. As the market share of n-type solar cells (with p+-emitters) is expected to rise in the near future, this passivation technique is particularly attractive and may become a new industry standard.
